## What is AeroSpace?

AeroSpace is a powerful tiling window manager for macOS that automatically arranges your windows in a non-overlapping layout. Unlike traditional macOS window management, AeroSpace uses keyboard-driven commands to manipulate windows efficiently, allowing you to focus on your work without constantly reaching for your mouse.

<Info>
  AeroSpace is inspired by i3 window manager from Linux, bringing its powerful tiling capabilities to macOS.
</Info>

## Key Features

- **Automatic Tiling**: Windows automatically arrange themselves in non-overlapping layouts
- **Keyboard-Driven**: Control everything with intuitive keyboard shortcuts
- **Multiple Workspaces**: Organize your work across 35 workspaces (1-9, A-Z)
- **Flexible Layouts**: Switch between tiles and accordion layouts
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Seamlessly manage windows across multiple displays
- **Mouse Follows Focus**: Automatically positions your cursor on the focused window

## Startup Configuration

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml
# Start AeroSpace at login
start-at-login = true

# You can use it to add commands that run after login to macOS user session.
after-login-command = []

# 'after-startup-command' is run after 'after-login-command'
after-startup-command = []
```

AeroSpace is configured to start automatically when you log in to macOS, ensuring your tiling window manager is always ready.

## Layout Configuration

### Default Layout

The configuration uses **tiles** as the default root container layout:

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml
# Possible values: tiles|accordion
default-root-container-layout = 'tiles'

# Possible values: horizontal|vertical|auto
# 'auto' means: wide monitor gets horizontal orientation,
#               tall monitor gets vertical orientation
default-root-container-orientation = 'auto'
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Tiles Layout">
    The tiles layout divides the screen into non-overlapping rectangles. Each window gets an equal share of the available space. This is the default and most commonly used layout.
    
    - Windows are arranged side-by-side or stacked
    - Orientation is automatically determined by monitor aspect ratio
    - All windows are always visible
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Accordion Layout">
    The accordion layout keeps one window maximized while others are minimized to the side. This is useful when you want to focus on one main window while keeping others accessible.
    
    - One window takes up most of the space
    - Other windows are shown as narrow strips
    - Quick access to background windows
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Accordion Padding

The `accordion-padding` setting controls the size of minimized windows in accordion mode:

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml
# The 'accordion-padding' specifies the size of accordion padding
# You can set 0 to disable the padding feature
accordion-padding = 30
```

<Note>
  A padding of 30 pixels provides enough space to see and click on minimized windows without taking up too much screen real estate.
</Note>

## Gaps Configuration

The configuration uses a **no-gaps** approach, where windows are flush against each other and the screen edges:

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml
[gaps]
inner.horizontal = 0
inner.vertical =   0
outer.left =       0
outer.bottom =     0
outer.top =        0
outer.right =      0
```

| Gap Type | Purpose | Value |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `inner.horizontal` | Space between windows horizontally | 0 |
| `inner.vertical` | Space between windows vertically | 0 |
| `outer.left` | Space from left monitor edge | 0 |
| `outer.right` | Space from right monitor edge | 0 |
| `outer.top` | Space from top monitor edge | 0 |
| `outer.bottom` | Space from bottom monitor edge | 0 |

<Info>
  If you prefer visual separation between windows, you can increase these values. For example, setting `inner.horizontal = 10` and `inner.vertical = 10` creates a 10-pixel gap between windows.
</Info>

## Normalization Settings

AeroSpace includes normalization features that automatically optimize your window tree structure:

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml
# Normalizations. See: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#normalization
enable-normalization-flatten-containers = true
enable-normalization-opposite-orientation-for-nested-containers = true
```

<Accordion title="What does normalization do?">
  **Flatten Containers**: Automatically flattens unnecessary nested containers, keeping your window tree structure simple and predictable.
  
  **Opposite Orientation for Nested Containers**: When creating nested containers, AeroSpace automatically uses the opposite orientation (horizontal vs. vertical) to create more intuitive layouts.
  
  These features work behind the scenes to ensure your layouts behave as expected without manual intervention.
</Accordion>

## Mouse Behavior

AeroSpace is configured to automatically move your mouse cursor to follow focus changes:

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml
# Mouse follows focus when focused monitor changes
on-focused-monitor-changed = ['move-mouse monitor-lazy-center']

# Mouse follows focus when focused window changes
on-focus-changed = "move-mouse window-lazy-center"
```

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Window Focus Change">
    When you focus a different window (e.g., using `Alt+H/J/K/L`), the mouse cursor automatically moves to the center of the newly focused window.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Focus Change">
    When focus moves to a window on a different monitor, the cursor moves to the center of that monitor.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Lazy Center">
    The "lazy-center" behavior means the cursor only moves if it's not already on the focused window/monitor, reducing unnecessary cursor movements.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  If you prefer manual mouse control, you can remove these settings from your configuration. However, many users find that mouse-follows-focus significantly improves workflow when using keyboard-driven window management.
</Warning>

## Keyboard Layout

The configuration uses the QWERTY keyboard layout preset:

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml
# Possible values: (qwerty|dvorak)
key-mapping.preset = 'qwerty'
```

<Note>
  If you use Dvorak keyboard layout, change this to `'dvorak'` to ensure keybindings match your physical keyboard layout.
