## Overview

AeroSpace is controlled entirely through keyboard shortcuts. All keybindings use the `Alt` key as the primary modifier, with `Shift` for secondary actions like moving windows instead of focusing them.

<Info>
  AeroSpace uses Vim-style directional keys (H, J, K, L) for navigation, making it intuitive for developers familiar with Vim or modal editors.
</Info>

## Window Focus

Move focus between windows using Vim-style directional keys:

| Keybinding | Command | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `Alt+H` | `focus left` | Focus the window to the left |
| `Alt+J` | `focus down` | Focus the window below |
| `Alt+K` | `focus up` | Focus the window above |
| `Alt+L` | `focus right` | Focus the window to the right |

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml:91-94
alt-h = 'focus left'
alt-j = 'focus down'
alt-k = 'focus up'
alt-l = 'focus right'
```

<Note>
  Focus commands are the most frequently used keybindings. They allow you to navigate between windows without using your mouse.
</Note>

## Window Movement

Move windows to different positions by adding `Shift` to the focus keys:

| Keybinding | Command | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `Alt+Shift+H` | `move left` | Move current window to the left |
| `Alt+Shift+J` | `move down` | Move current window down |
| `Alt+Shift+K` | `move up` | Move current window up |
| `Alt+Shift+L` | `move right` | Move current window to the right |

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml:97-100
alt-shift-h = 'move left'
alt-shift-j = 'move down'
alt-shift-k = 'move up'
alt-shift-l = 'move right'
```

<Accordion title="Understanding window movement">
  Window movement swaps the position of the current window with its neighbor in the specified direction. If there's no neighbor in that direction, the window may be moved to a new container or split.
  
  This is useful for:
  - Rearranging windows in your current layout
  - Moving windows between splits
  - Reorganizing your workspace layout
</Accordion>

## Window Resizing

Resize the focused window using smart resize commands:

| Keybinding | Command | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `Alt+Shift+-` | `resize smart -50` | Decrease window size by 50 pixels |
| `Alt+Shift+=` | `resize smart +50` | Increase window size by 50 pixels |

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml:103-104
alt-shift-minus = 'resize smart -50'
alt-shift-equal = 'resize smart +50'
```

<Info>
  The "smart" resize automatically determines which dimension (width or height) to adjust based on the window's position and orientation in the layout.
</Info>

## Layout Switching

Switch between different layout modes:

| Keybinding | Command | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `Alt+/` | `layout tiles horizontal vertical` | Toggle tiles layout between horizontal and vertical |
| `Alt+,` | `layout accordion horizontal vertical` | Toggle accordion layout between horizontal and vertical |

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml:87-88
alt-slash = 'layout tiles horizontal vertical'
alt-comma = 'layout accordion horizontal vertical'
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Tiles Layout (Alt+/)">
    Cycles through tiles layouts:
    - **Horizontal tiles**: Windows are arranged side-by-side
    - **Vertical tiles**: Windows are stacked top-to-bottom
    
    Use this when you want all windows to be equally visible.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Accordion Layout (Alt+,)">
    Cycles through accordion layouts:
    - **Horizontal accordion**: Main window on left, others minimized to the right
    - **Vertical accordion**: Main window on top, others minimized to the bottom
    
    Use this when you want to focus on one main window while keeping others accessible.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Workspace Navigation

Switch between workspaces instantly:

### Number Workspaces (1-9)

| Keybinding | Workspace |
|------------|----------|
| `Alt+1` | Workspace 1 |
| `Alt+2` | Workspace 2 |

alt-2 = 'workspace 2'
alt-3 = 'workspace 3'
# ... (continues for all workspaces)
alt-a = 'workspace A'
alt-b = 'workspace B'
# ... (continues through Z)
```

<Note>
  You can customize which letter workspaces you actually use. The configuration includes all 26 letters, but you can remove bindings you don't need.
</Note>

## Moving Windows to Workspaces

Move the focused window to a specific workspace using `Alt+Shift+[key]`:

### Number Workspaces (1-9)

  | | | | `Alt+Shift+Y` | Move to Workspace Y |
  | | | | `Alt+Shift+Z` | Move to Workspace Z |
</Accordion>

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml:140-170
alt-shift-1 = 'move-node-to-workspace 1'
alt-shift-2 = 'move-node-to-workspace 2'
alt-shift-3 = 'move-node-to-workspace 3'
# ... (continues for all workspaces)
alt-shift-a = 'move-node-to-workspace A'
alt-shift-b = 'move-node-to-workspace B'
# ... (continues through Z)
```

## Workspace Management

Quickly navigate between workspaces and monitors:

| Keybinding | Command | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `Alt+Tab` | `workspace-back-and-forth` | Switch to the previously focused workspace |
| `Alt+Shift+Tab` | `move-workspace-to-monitor --wrap-around next` | Move current workspace to the next monitor |

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml:173-175
alt-tab = 'workspace-back-and-forth'
alt-shift-tab = 'move-workspace-to-monitor --wrap-around next'
```

<Info>
  The `workspace-back-and-forth` command is incredibly useful for switching between two workspaces you're actively working in. It's similar to Alt+Tab for applications, but for entire workspaces.
</Info>

## Service Mode

Access advanced window management commands through service mode:

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|--------|
| `Alt+Shift+;` | Enter service mode |

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml:178
alt-shift-semicolon = 'mode service'
```

### Service Mode Commands

Once in service mode, you have access to these commands:

| Keybinding | Command | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `Esc` | `reload-config` + `mode main` | Reload configuration and exit to main mode |
| `R` | `flatten-workspace-tree` + `mode main` | Reset layout and exit to main mode |
| `F` | `layout floating tiling` + `mode main` | Toggle between floating and tiling layout |
| `Backspace` | `close-all-windows-but-current` + `mode main` | Close all windows except the focused one |
| `Alt+Shift+H` | `join-with left` + `mode main` | Join current window with the window on the left |
| `Alt+Shift+J` | `join-with down` + `mode main` | Join current window with the window below |
| `Alt+Shift+K` | `join-with up` + `mode main` | Join current window with the window above |
| `Alt+Shift+L` | `join-with right` + `mode main` | Join current window with the window on the right |

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml:183-192
[mode.service.binding]
esc = ['reload-config', 'mode main']
r = ['flatten-workspace-tree', 'mode main'] # reset layout
f = ['layout floating tiling', 'mode main'] # Toggle between floating and tiling layout
backspace = ['close-all-windows-but-current', 'mode main']

alt-shift-h = ['join-with left', 'mode main']
alt-shift-j = ['join-with down', 'mode main']
alt-shift-k = ['join-with up', 'mode main']
alt-shift-l = ['join-with right', 'mode main']
```

<Accordion title="Understanding service mode commands">
  **Reload Config (Esc)**: After making changes to your `aerospace.toml` file, use this to apply them without restarting AeroSpace.
  
  **Reset Layout (R)**: Flattens the workspace tree, removing all nested containers and returning to a simple layout. Useful when your layout becomes too complex.
  
  **Toggle Floating (F)**: Switches the current window between tiling and floating mode. Floating windows can be moved and resized freely like traditional macOS windows.
  
  **Close All But Current (Backspace)**: Quickly clean up a workspace by closing all windows except the one you're focused on.
  
  **Join With (Alt+Shift+H/J/K/L)**: Creates a tabbed or stacked container by joining the current window with a neighbor. This is an advanced feature for creating more complex layouts.
</Accordion>

<Warning>
  Service mode commands are powerful. The `close-all-windows-but-current` command will close windows without prompting. Make sure you've saved your work before using it.
</Warning>
