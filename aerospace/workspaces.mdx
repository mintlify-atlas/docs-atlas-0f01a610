## Overview

AeroSpace provides 35 virtual workspaces (1-9 and A-Z) that function as independent virtual desktops. Each workspace maintains its own window layout, allowing you to organize different tasks, projects, or contexts separately.

<Info>
  Think of workspaces as separate virtual monitors. You can have a different set of windows on each workspace, and switch between them instantly with a simple keyboard shortcut.
</Info>

## Available Workspaces

AeroSpace offers two categories of workspaces:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Number Workspaces (1-9)">
    Nine numeric workspaces accessed via `Alt+[1-9]`:
    
    - Workspace 1
    - Workspace 2
    - Workspace 3
    - Workspace 4
    - Workspace 5
    - Workspace 6
    - Workspace 7
    - Workspace 8
    - Workspace 9
    
    These are typically used for your most frequent tasks or applications.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Letter Workspaces (A-Z)">
    Twenty-six alphabetic workspaces accessed via `Alt+[A-Z]`:
    
    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
    
    <Note>
      The letters H, J, K, and L are not available as workspaces because they're reserved for window focus navigation (left, down, up, right).
    </Note>
    
    Letter workspaces provide extensive organizational capacity for power users managing many different contexts.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Workspace Organization Strategies

Here are some common patterns for organizing workspaces:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="By Task Type" icon="list-check">
    - Workspace 1: Web browsing
    - Workspace 2: Code editor
    - Workspace 3: Terminal
    - Workspace 4: Communication (Slack, Email)
    - Workspace 5: Documentation
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="By Project" icon="folder-tree">
    - Workspace A: Project Alpha
    - Workspace B: Project Beta
    - Workspace C: Project Charlie
    - Each workspace contains all apps for that project
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="By Client/Context" icon="users">
    - Workspace 1-3: Client A work
    - Workspace 4-6: Client B work
    - Workspace 7-9: Internal projects
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Hybrid Approach" icon="layer-group">
    - Numbers (1-9): Daily applications
    - Letters (A-Z): Project-specific workspaces
    - Mix permanent and temporary workspaces
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Switching Between Workspaces

Navigate to any workspace instantly using `Alt+[key]`:

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml:107-137
alt-1 = 'workspace 1'
alt-2 = 'workspace 2'
alt-3 = 'workspace 3'
alt-4 = 'workspace 4'
alt-5 = 'workspace 5'
alt-6 = 'workspace 6'
alt-7 = 'workspace 7'
alt-8 = 'workspace 8'
alt-9 = 'workspace 9'
alt-a = 'workspace A'
alt-b = 'workspace B'
# ... (continues through all letter workspaces)
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Press Alt + Number/Letter">
    Hold down `Alt` and press the number or letter key corresponding to the workspace you want to view.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Instant Switch">
    AeroSpace immediately switches to the selected workspace, showing all windows arranged in that workspace's layout.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Empty Workspaces">
    If a workspace is empty (no windows), you'll see a blank screen. You can open new applications or move windows to this workspace.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Start on Workspace 1 (browser)
Alt+1

# Switch to Workspace 2 (code editor)
Alt+2

# Jump to Workspace C (specific project)
Alt+C

# Return to Workspace 1
Alt+1
```

## Moving Windows to Workspaces

Move the currently focused window to any workspace using `Alt+Shift+[key]`:

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml:140-170
alt-shift-1 = 'move-node-to-workspace 1'
alt-shift-2 = 'move-node-to-workspace 2'
alt-shift-3 = 'move-node-to-workspace 3'
alt-shift-4 = 'move-node-to-workspace 4'
alt-shift-5 = 'move-node-to-workspace 5'
alt-shift-6 = 'move-node-to-workspace 6'
alt-shift-7 = 'move-node-to-workspace 7'
alt-shift-8 = 'move-node-to-workspace 8'
alt-shift-9 = 'move-node-to-workspace 9'
alt-shift-a = 'move-node-to-workspace A'
alt-shift-b = 'move-node-to-workspace B'
# ... (continues through all letter workspaces)
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Focus the Window">
    Use `Alt+H/J/K/L` to focus the window you want to move.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Move to Workspace">
    Press `Alt+Shift+[key]` where `[key]` is the destination workspace number or letter.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Window Moves Instantly">
    The window disappears from your current workspace and is moved to the destination workspace. You remain on your current workspace.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Follow the Window (Optional)">
    If you want to follow the window, press `Alt+[key]` to switch to the destination workspace.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Move and Follow Pattern

```bash
# You're on Workspace 1 with your browser focused
# You want to move it to Workspace 3

Alt+Shift+3    # Move browser to Workspace 3
Alt+3          # Follow it to Workspace 3
```

<Note>
  This two-step pattern (move + switch) is common when reorganizing your workspaces. You can move multiple windows before switching to see the results.
</Note>

## Workspace Back-and-Forth

Quickly toggle between two workspaces using the back-and-forth command:

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml:173
alt-tab = 'workspace-back-and-forth'
```

### How It Works

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Behavior">
    The `workspace-back-and-forth` command switches to the previously focused workspace, creating a toggle effect:
    
    1. You're on Workspace 1
    2. Press `Alt+3` to go to Workspace 3
    3. Press `Alt+Tab` - returns to Workspace 1
    4. Press `Alt+Tab` again - returns to Workspace 3
    5. Continue pressing `Alt+Tab` to toggle between them
    
    This creates a quick "Alt+Tab" experience but for entire workspaces instead of individual windows.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Use Cases">
    Perfect for workflows that involve two contexts:
    
    - **Development**: Toggle between code editor (Workspace 2) and terminal (Workspace 3)
    - **Reference Work**: Toggle between document (Workspace 1) and reference material (Workspace 4)
    - **Communication**: Toggle between work apps (Workspace 1) and communication tools (Workspace C)
    - **Testing**: Toggle between development (Workspace 2) and testing (Workspace T)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Accordion title="Example: Development Workflow">
  You're developing a feature and need to switch between your code editor and browser frequently:
  
  1. Start on Workspace 2 (code editor)
  2. Make some changes to your code
  3. Press `Alt+1` to switch to Workspace 1 (browser)
  4. Test your changes
  5. Press `Alt+Tab` to return to Workspace 2 (code editor)
  6. Make more changes
  7. Press `Alt+Tab` to return to Workspace 1 (browser)
  8. Continue using `Alt+Tab` to toggle between coding and testing
  
  This is much faster than pressing `Alt+1` and `Alt+2` repeatedly.
</Accordion>

## Moving Workspaces Between Monitors

If you have multiple monitors, you can move entire workspaces between them:

```toml aerospace/aerospace.toml:175
alt-shift-tab = 'move-workspace-to-monitor --wrap-around next'
```

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Focus a Workspace">
    You're currently viewing a workspace on one of your monitors.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Move to Next Monitor">
    Press `Alt+Shift+Tab` to move the entire workspace (with all its windows) to the next monitor.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wrap Around">
    The `--wrap-around` flag means if you're on the last monitor, it wraps back to the first monitor.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Focus Follows Workspace">
    Your focus automatically follows the workspace to its new monitor location.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Multi-Monitor Workflow

<Accordion title="Example: Three-Monitor Setup">
  You have three monitors arranged as: Left | Center | Right
  
  **Scenario**: Workspace 2 is on your center monitor, but you want to move it to your right monitor.
  
  ```bash
  Alt+2                # Ensure you're viewing Workspace 2
  Alt+Shift+Tab        # Moves Workspace 2 to the right monitor
  ```
  
  If you press `Alt+Shift+Tab` again, it moves to the left monitor (wrapping around).
  
  **Use Case**: You start working on your laptop, then connect external monitors. You can quickly reorganize which workspaces appear on which monitors without manually moving individual windows.
</Accordion>

<Info>
  This command moves the entire workspace, preserving all window layouts and arrangements. It's much faster than moving windows individually.
</Info>

## Workspace States

Workspaces in AeroSpace can be in different states:

| State | Description | Behavior |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Empty** | No windows present | Workspace exists but shows empty screen when viewed |
| **Active** | Contains windows and is currently visible | You can see and interact with the windows |
| **Background** | Contains windows but not currently visible | Windows continue running but are not displayed |
| **Focused** | Currently active and has keyboard/mouse focus | This is the workspace you're actively using |

<Note>
  Applications continue running on background workspaces. Switching workspaces doesn't pause or suspend applications - it just changes which windows you can see.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep It Simple">
    Don't feel pressured to use all 35 workspaces. Many users find 4-6 workspaces sufficient for their workflow. Start small and add more as you find the need.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Consistent Organization">
    Develop a consistent system for what goes where. For example, always keep your browser on Workspace 1, code editor on Workspace 2, etc. Muscle memory makes workspace switching nearly automatic.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Letter Workspaces for Projects">
    Reserve letter workspaces for temporary project-specific work. When a project is complete, you can clear that workspace and reuse the letter for a new project.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Empty Unused Workspaces">
    Close all windows on workspaces you're not actively using. This keeps your system resources focused on what you're actually working on.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Workspace-to-Monitor Assignments">
    If you have multiple monitors, consider which workspaces naturally belong on which monitor. Use `Alt+Shift+Tab` to set up your ideal arrangement when you start your workday.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Workflows

### Developer Workflow

```bash
Workspace 1: Browser (documentation, testing)
Workspace 2: Code Editor (VSCode, Vim)
Workspace 3: Terminal (build, run, test)
Workspace 4: Database client / API testing
Workspace 5: Slack / Communication

# Typical flow:
Alt+2          # Write code
Alt+3          # Run build/tests
Alt+1          # Check browser result
Alt+Tab        # Back to code (using back-and-forth)
Alt+5          # Check Slack messages
Alt+Tab        # Return to previous workspace
```

### Content Creation Workflow

```bash
Workspace W: Writing (editor)
Workspace R: Research (browser with reference tabs)
Workspace I: Images (design tools, image editor)
Workspace P: Preview (output viewer, PDF reader)

# Typical flow:
Alt+W          # Write content
Alt+R          # Research and gather information
Alt+I          # Create or edit images
Alt+P          # Preview final output
Alt+Tab        # Toggle between current and previous workspace
```

### Multi-Project Management

```bash
Workspace A: Project Alpha (all related windows)
Workspace B: Project Beta (all related windows)
Workspace C: Project Charlie (all related windows)
Workspace 1-5: Shared tools (browser, email, Slack, etc.)

# Switch contexts:
Alt+A          # Focus on Project Alpha
Alt+1          # Check email
Alt+B          # Switch to Project Beta
Alt+Tab        # Back to Project Alpha quickly
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I switched to a workspace but see a blank screen">
    This is normal - the workspace is empty. Either open new applications on this workspace or move windows here from other workspaces using `Alt+Shift+[key]`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Lost track of which workspace contains a specific window">
    Cycle through your workspaces using `Alt+[key]` to find it. Alternatively, consider organizing your workspaces more consistently so you know where things are.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Moved a window to wrong workspace">
    Simply focus the window and press `Alt+Shift+[key]` to move it to the correct workspace. You can also switch to that workspace first (`Alt+[key]`), focus the window, then move it.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Back-and-forth isn't working as expected">
    The `Alt+Tab` command only toggles between the current workspace and the last workspace you explicitly switched to. If you switch to multiple workspaces quickly, only the last one is remembered.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Tips

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Quick Reorganization" icon="arrows-rotate">
    To reorganize windows across workspaces:
    1. Switch to source workspace
    2. Move all windows to target workspaces
    3. Switch to target workspace to verify
    4. Repeat as needed
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Workspace Templates" icon="clone">
    Develop "template" layouts for common tasks:
    - Development: editor + terminal + browser
    - Writing: editor + research browser + preview
    - Design: design tool + reference + export preview
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Monitor-Specific Workspaces" icon="display">
    On multi-monitor setups, assign specific workspace ranges to specific monitors:
    - Left monitor: Workspaces 1-3
    - Center monitor: Workspaces 4-6
    - Right monitor: Workspaces 7-9
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Rapid Context Switching" icon="bolt">
    Use back-and-forth (`Alt+Tab`) for two workspaces you're actively working in, and direct keys (`Alt+[key]`) for less frequent switches.
