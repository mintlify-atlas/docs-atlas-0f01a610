## What's Inside

This configuration repository brings together four essential components of a modern development environment:

### Neovim with LazyVim

A powerful, extensible text editor configuration built on top of [LazyVim](https://lazyvim.github.io/), featuring:

- **Smart Plugin Management**: Lazy-loaded plugins for optimal startup performance
- **Multiple Colorschemes**: Kanagawa, PaperColor, Gruvbox, Rose Pine, TokyoDark, Everforest, and OneDark
- **Obsidian Integration**: Seamless note-taking with the Obsidian.nvim plugin
- **LeetCode Support**: Practice coding challenges directly in your editor
- **Enhanced Autocompletion**: Custom tab completion configuration for better development experience
- **Vim Practice**: Built-in VimBeGood plugin for improving your Vim skills

### Alacritty Terminal

A GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that's both beautiful and performant:

- **150+ Themes**: Extensive theme collection including Catppuccin, Tokyo Night, Dracula, Nord, and more
- **Optimized Display**: Custom opacity (0.8), blur effects, and buttonless window decorations
- **Modern Typography**: 0xProto Nerd Font Mono at 16pt for excellent readability
- **Full 256-color Support**: True color rendering for beautiful syntax highlighting
- **Maximized by Default**: Launches in fullscreen for maximum workspace

### Tmux Configuration

Professional terminal multiplexing with an emphasis on productivity:

- **Vim Keybindings**: Navigate and manage panes with familiar Vim motions
- **Custom Prefix**: Uses `Ctrl+Space` instead of the default `Ctrl+b`
- **Catppuccin Theme**: Beautiful, consistent theming across your terminal environment
- **Copy Mode**: Vim-style visual selection with `v`, `y`, and `V` keys
- **TPM Integration**: Tmux Plugin Manager for easy plugin installation
- **Mouse Support**: Optional mouse interaction for convenience
- **True Color Support**: 256-color terminal with RGB and italics support

### AeroSpace Window Manager

A tiling window manager specifically designed for macOS:

- **Vim-Style Navigation**: Use `Alt+h/j/k/l` to move between windows
- **Flexible Layouts**: Switch between tiles and accordion layouts on the fly
- **Multiple Workspaces**: Support for numbered (1-9) and lettered (A-Z) workspaces
- **Smart Resizing**: Intelligent window resizing with `Alt+Shift+-/=`
- **Service Mode**: Advanced window management features accessible via `Alt+Shift+;`
- **Mouse Integration**: Automatically centers mouse on focused window
- **Auto-normalization**: Smart container flattening and orientation handling

    Every tool in this configuration supports Vim keybindings and workflows. Navigate your editor, terminal multiplexer, and window manager with the same muscle memory.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance Optimized">
    From Alacritty's GPU acceleration to LazyVim's lazy-loaded plugins, every component is configured for maximum performance without sacrificing features.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Easily Customizable">
    All configuration files are well-organized and documented. Change themes, keybindings, and behaviors without diving into complex documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Developer-Focused">
    Built with real development workflows in mind, including support for note-taking (Obsidian), coding practice (LeetCode), and efficient window management.
  </Accordion>

## Who Is This For?

 This configuration is ideal for:

- Developers transitioning to or optimizing their macOS setup
- Vim/Neovim enthusiasts who want a cohesive, keyboard-driven environment
- Anyone seeking a beautiful, productive terminal-based workflow
- Developers who value open-source, community-driven tools
- Those who want a solid foundation they can customize to their needs

<Note>
  This configuration is specifically designed for macOS. While the Neovim, Alacritty, and Tmux configurations are cross-platform, AeroSpace is macOS-exclusive. Linux users should consider alternative tiling window managers like i3, sway, or bspwm.
