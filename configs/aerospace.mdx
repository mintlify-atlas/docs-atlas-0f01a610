description: Tiling window manager for macOS with i3-like keybindings and automatic workspace management
---

## Overview

AeroSpace is a modern tiling window manager for macOS that brings i3/Sway-style window management to the Mac platform. It provides automatic window tiling, workspace management, and keyboard-driven window navigation without the need for disabling System Integrity Protection (SIP).

## Configuration File

The configuration is located at `aerospace/aerospace.toml` and should be placed at `~/.aerospace.toml`.

## Core Settings

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Startup & Lifecycle">
    ### Startup Configuration

    ```toml
    # Start AeroSpace at login
    start-at-login = true

    # You can use it to add commands that run after login to macOS user session.
    # 'start-at-login' needs to be 'true' for 'after-login-command' to work
    after-login-command = []

    # You can use it to add commands that run after AeroSpace startup.
    # 'after-startup-command' is run after 'after-login-command'
    after-startup-command = []
    ```

    **Lifecycle:**
    1. macOS login
    2. AeroSpace auto-starts (if `start-at-login = true`)
    3. `after-login-command` executes
    4. `after-startup-command` executes

    <Accordion title="Example Startup Commands">
      You could add commands like:
      ```toml
      after-startup-command = [
        'exec-and-forget open -a "Alacritty"',
        'exec-and-forget open -a "Firefox"'
      ]
      ```
    </Accordion>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Layout & Normalization">
    ### Window Normalizations

    ```toml
    # Normalizations. See: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#normalization
    enable-normalization-flatten-containers = true
    enable-normalization-opposite-orientation-for-nested-containers = true
    ```

    **What normalizations do:**

    - **flatten-containers**: Automatically removes unnecessary container nesting
    - **opposite-orientation-for-nested-containers**: Prevents same-orientation nesting (e.g., horizontal inside horizontal)

    These settings keep the window tree clean and predictable.

    ### Default Layout

    ```toml
    # See: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#layouts
    # The 'accordion-padding' specifies the size of accordion padding
    # You can set 0 to disable the padding feature
    accordion-padding = 30

    # Possible values: tiles|accordion
    default-root-container-layout = 'tiles'

    # Possible values: horizontal|vertical|auto
    # 'auto' means: wide monitor (anything wider than high) gets horizontal orientation,
    #               tall monitor (anything higher than wide) gets vertical orientation
    default-root-container-orientation = 'auto'
    ```

    **Layout Modes:**

    - **Tiles**: Traditional tiling layout, windows split space evenly
    - **Accordion**: One main window takes focus, others are minimized to a strip

    **Orientation:**

    - `auto` automatically chooses based on monitor aspect ratio
    - Wide monitors (16:9, 21:9) get horizontal splits
    - Tall monitors (portrait) get vertical splits

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Gaps & Mouse Behavior">
    ### Gaps Configuration

    ```toml
    [gaps]
    inner.horizontal = 0
    inner.vertical =   0
    outer.left =       0
    outer.bottom =     0
    outer.top =        0
    outer.right =      0
    ```

    **Gap Types:**

    - **Inner gaps**: Space between windows
    - **Outer gaps**: Space between windows and screen edges

    Current configuration uses zero gaps for maximum screen space utilization.

    <Accordion title="Example with Gaps">
      For a more aesthetic setup with spacing:
      ```toml
      [gaps]
      inner.horizontal = 10
      inner.vertical =   10
      outer.left =       10
      outer.bottom =     10
      outer.top =        10
      outer.right =      10
      ```
    </Accordion>

    ### Mouse Behavior

    ```toml
    # Mouse follows focus when focused monitor changes
    on-focused-monitor-changed = ['move-mouse monitor-lazy-center']
    on-focus-changed = "move-mouse window-lazy-center"
    ```

    **Automatic mouse positioning:**
    - When switching monitors, mouse moves to center of new monitor
    - When switching windows, mouse moves to center of new window
    - "lazy" means mouse only moves if it's not already in the target area

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Key Mapping">
    ### Keyboard Layout

    ```toml
    # Possible values: (qwerty|dvorak)
    # See https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#key-mapping
    key-mapping.preset = 'qwerty'
    ```

    AeroSpace supports different keyboard layouts for consistent keybindings across layouts.

## Keybindings

### Window Navigation

```toml
# See: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands#focus
alt-h = 'focus left'
alt-j = 'focus down'
alt-k = 'focus up'
alt-l = 'focus right'
```

**Vim-style navigation:**
- `Alt+h` - Focus window to the left
- `Alt+j` - Focus window below
- `Alt+k` - Focus window above
- `Alt+l` - Focus window to the right

### Window Movement

```toml
# See: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands#move
alt-shift-h = 'move left'
alt-shift-j = 'move down'
alt-shift-k = 'move up'
alt-shift-l = 'move right'
```

**Moving windows:**
- `Alt+Shift+h` - Move window left
- `Alt+Shift+j` - Move window down
- `Alt+Shift+k` - Move window up
- `Alt+Shift+l` - Move window right

### Layout Management

```toml
# See: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands#layout
alt-slash = 'layout tiles horizontal vertical'
alt-comma = 'layout accordion horizontal vertical'
```

**Layout switching:**
- `Alt+/` - Toggle between horizontal and vertical tiles layout
- `Alt+,` - Toggle between horizontal and vertical accordion layout

### Window Resizing

```toml
# See: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands#resize
alt-shift-minus = 'resize smart -50'
alt-shift-equal = 'resize smart +50'
```

**Smart resizing:**
- `Alt+Shift+-` - Shrink focused window by 50 pixels
- `Alt+Shift+=` - Grow focused window by 50 pixels
- "smart" automatically determines the best resize direction

## Workspace Management

### Switching Workspaces

```toml
# See: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands#workspace
alt-1 = 'workspace 1'
alt-2 = 'workspace 2'
alt-3 = 'workspace 3'
alt-4 = 'workspace 4'
alt-5 = 'workspace 5'
alt-6 = 'workspace 6'
alt-7 = 'workspace 7'
alt-8 = 'workspace 8'
alt-9 = 'workspace 9'

# Named workspaces
alt-a = 'workspace A'
alt-b = 'workspace B'
alt-c = 'workspace C'
alt-d = 'workspace D'
alt-e = 'workspace E'
alt-f = 'workspace F'
alt-g = 'workspace G'
alt-i = 'workspace I'
alt-m = 'workspace M'
alt-n = 'workspace N'
alt-o = 'workspace O'
alt-p = 'workspace P'
alt-q = 'workspace Q'
alt-r = 'workspace R'
alt-s = 'workspace S'
alt-t = 'workspace T'
alt-u = 'workspace U'
alt-v = 'workspace V'
alt-w = 'workspace W'
alt-x = 'workspace X'
alt-y = 'workspace Y'
alt-z = 'workspace Z'
```

<Note>
  This configuration provides both numbered workspaces (1-9) and named workspaces (A-Z). You can remove unused workspace bindings to simplify your configuration.
</Note>

**Workspace naming ideas:**
- `W` - Web browsers
- `C` - Code/Development
- `T` - Terminal
- `M` - Music/Media
- `E` - Email/Communication

### Moving Windows to Workspaces

```toml
# See: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands#move-node-to-workspace
alt-shift-1 = 'move-node-to-workspace 1'
alt-shift-2 = 'move-node-to-workspace 2'
alt-shift-3 = 'move-node-to-workspace 3'
# ... (continues for all workspaces)
```

**Moving windows:**
- `Alt+Shift+1` - Move focused window to workspace 1
- `Alt+Shift+W` - Move focused window to workspace W
- etc.

### Workspace Navigation

```toml
# See: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands#workspace-back-and-forth
alt-tab = 'workspace-back-and-forth'

# See: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands#move-workspace-to-monitor
alt-shift-tab = 'move-workspace-to-monitor --wrap-around next'
```

**Quick navigation:**
- `Alt+Tab` - Switch to previously focused workspace
- `Alt+Shift+Tab` - Move current workspace to next monitor

## Service Mode

```toml
# See: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/commands#mode
alt-shift-semicolon = 'mode service'

# 'service' binding mode declaration.
[mode.service.binding]
esc = ['reload-config', 'mode main']
r = ['flatten-workspace-tree', 'mode main'] # reset layout
f = ['layout floating tiling', 'mode main'] # Toggle between floating and tiling layout
backspace = ['close-all-windows-but-current', 'mode main']

alt-shift-h = ['join-with left', 'mode main']
alt-shift-j = ['join-with down', 'mode main']
alt-shift-k = ['join-with up', 'mode main']
alt-shift-l = ['join-with right', 'mode main']
```

**Service mode** provides maintenance and advanced operations:

1. Enter service mode: `Alt+Shift+;`
2. Perform action:
   - `Esc` - Reload configuration and exit
   - `r` - Reset/flatten workspace layout
   - `f` - Toggle floating mode for current window
   - `Backspace` - Close all windows except focused one
   - `Alt+Shift+h/j/k/l` - Join windows together
3. Returns to main mode automatically after action

<Accordion title="What is 'join-with'?">
  The `join-with` command allows you to join two windows into a container:
  - Creates a tabbed or stacked container
  - Useful for grouping related windows
  - Can be split again later

  Example: Join your terminal with your editor to keep them grouped.
</Accordion>

## Workflow Examples

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Setup
1. Alt+C → Switch to Code workspace
2. Open editor (VSCode/Neovim)
3. Alt+/ → Toggle to horizontal layout
4. Alt+Shift+T → Move terminal to workspace T
5. Alt+T → Switch to Terminal workspace
6. Alt+Tab → Jump between Code and Terminal
```

### Multi-Monitor Setup

```bash
# Moving workspaces between monitors
1. Alt+1 → Go to workspace 1
2. Alt+Shift+Tab → Move workspace 1 to next monitor
3. Workspace 1 now on second monitor
```

### Quick Window Management

```bash
# Resize and rearrange
1. Alt+h/j/k/l → Navigate to target window
2. Alt+Shift+h/j/k/l → Move window to desired position
3. Alt+Shift+= → Grow window
4. Alt+Shift+- → Shrink window
```

## Tips & Best Practices

<Note>
  **Workspace Strategy**: Organize workspaces by activity type (development, communication, research) rather than by application. This provides more flexibility.
</Note>

1. **Start small**: Begin with 3-4 workspaces and expand as needed
2. **Use named workspaces**: Easier to remember than numbers
3. **Learn service mode**: Powerful for quick adjustments
4. **Master navigation**: `Alt+h/j/k/l` becomes muscle memory quickly
5. **Adjust gaps**: Try non-zero gaps if you prefer visual separation
6. **Auto-start apps**: Use `after-startup-command` to launch your regular apps

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="AeroSpace not starting at login">
  1. Check System Preferences → Users & Groups → Login Items
  2. Ensure AeroSpace has permission in System Preferences → Security & Privacy
  3. Verify `start-at-login = true` in configuration
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keybindings not working">
  1. Check for conflicts with macOS shortcuts (System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts)
  2. Some apps capture Alt/Option key (particularly terminal apps)
  3. Try reloading config: `Alt+Shift+;` then `Esc`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Windows not tiling properly">
  Some macOS apps don't support tiling well:
  - System Preferences
  - Some menu bar apps
  - Apps with fixed window sizes

  Use `Alt+Shift+;` then `f` to toggle floating mode for these windows.
