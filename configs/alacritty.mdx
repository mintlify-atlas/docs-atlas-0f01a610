title: Alacritty Configuration
description: Fast, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator with transparency, custom fonts, and extensive theming
---

## Overview

Alacritty is a modern, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator written in Rust, known for its exceptional performance and minimalist configuration approach. This configuration provides a visually appealing setup with transparency effects, custom fonts, and a modular theming system.

## Configuration File

The main configuration is located at `alacritty/alacritty.toml` using the TOML format (as of Alacritty v0.13+).

<Note>
  Older versions of Alacritty used YAML format (`.yml`). This configuration uses the newer TOML format which is now the default.
</Note>

## Complete Configuration

```toml
general.import = [
    "~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes/coolnight.toml"
]

[ env ]
TERM = "xterm-256color"

[window]
padding.x = 10
padding.y = 10

decorations = "Buttonless"
opacity = 0.8
blur = true
startup_mode = "Maximized"

[font]
normal.family = "0xProto Nerd Font Mono"
size = 16
```

    ### Theme System

    ```toml
    general.import = [
        "~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes/coolnight.toml"
    ]
    ```

    **How it works:**
    - Alacritty's import system allows modular configuration
    - Themes are stored separately in `alacritty/themes/themes/` directory
    - The active theme (`coolnight.toml`) is imported at runtime
    - You can switch themes by changing the import path

    ### Available Themes

    The configuration includes an extensive theme collection with 100+ themes:

    <Accordion title="Popular Themes">
      - **Tokyo Night**: Modern dark theme with vibrant colors
      - **Nord**: Arctic, north-bluish color palette
      - **Catppuccin**: Soothing pastel theme with multiple variants
      - **Gruvbox**: Retro groove color scheme
      - **One Dark**: Atom's iconic theme
      - **Solarized**: Precision colors for machines and people
      - **Rose Pine**: All natural pine, faux fur and a bit of soho vibes
      - **Dracula**: Dark theme with vibrant colors
      - **Monokai**: Classic Sublime Text theme
    </Accordion>

    ### Switching Themes

    Simply change the import path to any theme in the themes directory:

    ```toml
    general.import = [
        "~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes/tokyo_night.toml"
    ]
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Window Settings">
    ### Window Configuration

    ```toml
    [window]
    padding.x = 10
    padding.y = 10

    decorations = "Buttonless"
    opacity = 0.8
    blur = true
    startup_mode = "Maximized"
    ```

    ### Padding

    ```toml
    padding.x = 10
    padding.y = 10
    ```

    - Adds 10 pixels of internal padding on all sides
    - Creates breathing room between terminal content and window edges
    - Values can be adjusted for personal preference

    ### Decorations

    ```toml
    decorations = "Buttonless"
    ```

    **Options:**
    - `"Full"` - Standard OS window decorations with title bar and buttons
    - `"None"` - No decorations at all (borderless)
    - `"Buttonless"` - Title bar without minimize/maximize/close buttons
    - `"Transparent"` - Transparent title bar (macOS only)

    The "Buttonless" option provides a clean, minimal look while maintaining the title bar for dragging.

    ### Opacity & Blur

    ```toml
    opacity = 0.8
    blur = true
    ```

    - **Opacity**: `0.8` means 80% opaque (20% transparent)
    - **Blur**: Applies background blur effect to transparent areas
    - Creates a modern, aesthetic appearance while maintaining readability
    - Requires compositor support (works natively on macOS, needs compositor on Linux)

    <Note>
      On Linux, you may need a compositor like picom or compton for blur effects to work.
    </Note>

    ### Startup Mode

    ```toml
    startup_mode = "Maximized"
    ```

    **Options:**
    - `"Windowed"` - Default window size
    - `"Maximized"` - Maximized window (current setting)
    - `"Fullscreen"` - Fullscreen mode
    - `"SimpleFullscreen"` - Fullscreen without window chrome (macOS)

  <Tab title="Font Settings">
    ### Font Configuration

    ```toml
    [font]
    normal.family = "0xProto Nerd Font Mono"
    size = 16
    ```

    ### Font Family: 0xProto Nerd Font

    **0xProto Nerd Font Mono** is a programming-focused font that includes:
    - Clear distinction between similar characters (0/O, 1/l/I)
    - Ligatures for common programming operators
    - Complete Nerd Font icon set (2000+ glyphs)
    - Optimized for long coding sessions

    <Accordion title="Why Nerd Fonts?">
      Nerd Fonts are patched fonts that include additional glyphs from popular icon fonts:
      - **Font Awesome**: Web icons
      - **Devicons**: Programming language icons
      - **Octicons**: GitHub icons
      - **Powerline**: Status line glyphs
      - **Material Design Icons**: Google's icon set

      These icons are essential for modern terminal tools like:
      - Oh My Zsh themes
      - Neovim status lines (lualine, etc.)
      - File managers (ranger, lf)
      - Git prompts
    </Accordion>

    ### Font Size

    ```toml
    size = 16
    ```

    - 16pt provides good readability on modern high-DPI displays
    - Adjust based on your monitor size and resolution
    - Common sizes: 12-14 (1080p), 14-16 (1440p), 16-18 (4K)

    ### Additional Font Styles

    While not configured, you can add:

    ```toml
    [font]
    normal.family = "0xProto Nerd Font Mono"
    bold.family = "0xProto Nerd Font Mono"
    italic.family = "0xProto Nerd Font Mono"
    bold_italic.family = "0xProto Nerd Font Mono"
    size = 16
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Environment">
    ### Environment Variables

    ```toml
    [ env ]
    TERM = "xterm-256color"
    ```

    **What this does:**
    - Sets the `$TERM` environment variable for programs running in Alacritty
    - `xterm-256color` enables 256-color support
    - Ensures compatibility with legacy applications expecting xterm

    ### Why xterm-256color?

    While Alacritty supports true color (24-bit), some applications check the `$TERM` variable:
    - Most modern apps detect capabilities automatically
    - `xterm-256color` is widely recognized and compatible
    - Alternative: `alacritty` (requires terminfo database installation)

    <Note>
      Tmux and Neovim will detect true color support regardless of the `$TERM` setting, thanks to terminfo capabilities.
    </Note>

## Theme Structure

Theme files in `alacritty/themes/themes/` follow this structure:

```toml
# Example: tokyo_night.toml
[colors.primary]
background = '#1a1b26'
foreground = '#a9b1d6'

[colors.normal]
black   = '#32344a'
red     = '#f7768e'
green   = '#9ece6a'
yellow  = '#e0af68'
blue    = '#7aa2f7'
magenta = '#ad8ee6'
cyan    = '#449dab'
white   = '#787c99'

[colors.bright]
black   = '#444b6a'
red     = '#ff7a93'
green   = '#b9f27c'
yellow  = '#ff9e64'
blue    = '#7da6ff'
magenta = '#bb9af7'
cyan    = '#0db9d7'
white   = '#acb0d0'
```

### Creating Custom Themes

To create your own theme:

1. Create a new `.toml` file in `alacritty/themes/themes/`
2. Define the color palette using the structure above
3. Import it in the main `alacritty.toml`

## Installing Fonts

### macOS

```bash
brew install font-0xproto-nerd-font
```

### Linux

```bash
# Download from Nerd Fonts releases
wget https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.1.1/0xProto.zip
unzip 0xProto.zip -d ~/.local/share/fonts
fc-cache -fv
```

### Windows

1. Download from [Nerd Fonts releases](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases)
2. Extract and install fonts by double-clicking
3. Restart Alacritty

## Performance Tips

<Note>
  Alacritty is already highly optimized, but these settings can help further:
</Note>

1. **Disable blur on low-end systems**: Set `blur = false` to reduce GPU load
2. **Reduce opacity**: Higher opacity values (closer to 1.0) render faster
3. **Use hardware-accelerated drivers**: Ensure your GPU drivers are up to date
4. **Monitor GPU usage**: Alacritty should use minimal GPU resources

## Common Customizations

### Cursor Configuration

```toml
[cursor]
style = { shape = "Block", blinking = "On" }
blink_interval = 750
```

### Scrollback Buffer

```toml
[scrolling]
history = 10000
multiplier = 3
```

### Key Bindings

```toml
[[keyboard.bindings]]
key = "N"
mods = "Command"
action = "CreateNewWindow"

[[keyboard.bindings]]
key = "K"
mods = "Command"
action = "ClearHistory"
```

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Colors look wrong in tmux">
  Make sure tmux is configured with true color support:

  ```bash
  set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"
  set -ga terminal-overrides ',xterm-256color:Tc'
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Font icons not showing">
  Ensure you're using a Nerd Font variant and the font is properly installed:

  ```bash
  fc-list | grep -i "0xProto"
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Transparency not working (Linux)">
  Install a compositor:

  ```bash
  # Arch/Manjaro
  sudo pacman -S picom

  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt install picom
  ```

  Then enable it in your window manager configuration.
